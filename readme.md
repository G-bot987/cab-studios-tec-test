To assess your front-end skills, please take a look at the following design:
 
https://www.figma.com/file/4yR4iLJCVJOTQuBgOnVplN/Two-Brindleyplace?node-id=0%3A1
 
Choose one page from this design, and make it a reality. This is to assess your front-end skills with html, css and js. You can use whichever tools, frameworks and libraries that you like for this task, you just need to make whichever page you choose look like the designs. If you log into Figma, you can export assets such as images, but you may use placeholders if you wish (hint: the inspect tab may also prove useful).
 
To assess some of your back-end skills please look into completing the following task in a language of your choice (but just so you know, we favour C#).
 
We have a list of IDs. Valid IDs only contain letters and/or numbers. No special characters are allowed. Process the following list below so that the following information is printed: a sequence of valid IDs. A sequence of invalid IDs, and their location in the original list. A sequence of valid IDs that contain letters only. A sequence of valid IDs that contain numbers only.
 
3wWY6, 1zxcz, 01743, qwerty, 4w0j7, ARNsf, 18335, NpnBU, Q_9ce, 5DDMo, 99785, 65742, ugKTV, VtUyC, hKeXz, 76243

Again you can use any tools you like for this task.
